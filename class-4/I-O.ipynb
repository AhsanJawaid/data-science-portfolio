    "File I/O allows interaction with external text or binary files for reading and writing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.1 Reading from a Text File**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading a file line by line\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",

    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2 Writing to a Text File**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file (overwrites existing content)\n",
    "with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, world!\\n\")\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **1.3 Using the `with` Statement**\n",

    "**Solution:**\n",

    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2 Exercise: Exception Handling in a Calculator**\n",
    "1. Write a calculator program that handles division by zero using exception handling.\n",
    "2. Ensure it prompts the user for valid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3 Exercise: Custom Exceptions for File Validation**\n",
    "1. Create a custom exception for missing files.\n",
    "2. Write a program that raises this exception if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FileNotFoundCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "### **4. Summary**\n",
    "- **File I/O**: Use `open()` for file operations and prefer the `with` statement to handle files efficiently.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**: Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors and ensure resource cleanup.\n",
    "- **Raising Exceptions**: Use `raise` to create custom error-handling logic.\n"
